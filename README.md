<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Various techniques have been developed to extract text successfully from images, the most famous being OCR. This project on font detection is intended to benefit various creaters that need to identify fonts suggestions from images or posters. Automatic font identification and similar font suggestion from an image or photo has been on the wish list of many designers. We want to take a step further to exploit the usage of OCR to predict the font used in images using deep learning techniques with python.

_For detailed explaination, please refer to the [Documentation](https://github.com/Kowshal19BCE1396/CBIVR-JComponent/tree/master/Documents)_

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.
<p align="right">(<a href="#Prerequisites">Here</a>)</p>

### Prerequisites

The prerequisites for the project are:

* Jupyter Notebook:
  JupyterLab can be installed with mamba and conda:
  ```sh
  mamba install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
  ```
  or
  ```sh
  conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
  ```
  Installation with pip
  ```sh
  pip install notebook
  ```

  To run the notebook, run the following command at the Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows):
  ```sh
  jupyter notebook
  ```


### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Kowshal19BCE1396/CBIVR-JComponent.git
   ```
2. The Dataset is also provided in [Dataset](https://github.com/Kowshal19BCE1396/CBIVR-JComponent/tree/master/Dataset)

## Acknowledgments

While relying upon the learning furthest reaches of CNN, we need to fight the dumbfound between available planning and testing data. The introduction of SCAE-based space adaption helps our pre-arranged model with achieving a higher than 80% top-5 accuracy. A unique lossless model tension is also applied to propel the model accumulating efficiency. The DeepFont system not only is convincing for text style affirmation, but can moreover convey a text style similarity measure for text style assurance and thought.
